# ToyDroneAssessment
Version 1.0
This software project, written using JavaScript, HTML and CSS simulates a toy drone on 10 x 10 square virtual surface. 
The user can issue the drone commands to move it around the surface. The drone will ignore any commands that direct it further than the boundary around the surface. 

This was the first project I have done where I have had to render graphics and manipulate them to meet requirements, 
so deciding on a suitable approach took away valuable development time. I considered using C# and Unity or Xamarim as I am most comfortable with C# but 
realized that I had to host the project so that it can be fully utilized on both mobile and computer devices. I decided to go with JavaScript front-end approach for generating 
graphic components but because I am not fully experienced in the language I met some barriers along the way.

I could not develop the project to a state I desired in the time frame due to choosing the wrong approach, 
however I understand the errors I made and identified an area of programming that
I need to allocate more time too. Post-assessment I will produce further versions of this project until it is in a state I am satsified with that meets all requirements. 

## Installation

1 - Use the following link to download the source code for the project https://github.com/daynemare/ToyDroneAssessment/archive/main.zip
2 - Unzip the "ToyDroneAssessment-main.Zip" folder.
3 - Click on the extracted folder and follow this folder path "ToyDroneSimAssessment">"src" > then open the "index.html" file in your browser. No IDE is required as I developed       the solution as a static web page.
